Your data has been encrypted, and we have taken copies of certain sensitive files.
This encryption was carried out for financial reasons, and a payment will be required before we can provide the tools needed to restore your data.
You will not be able to restore your data without our assistance. We can ensure full recovery if we work together.
To show that we are able to restore your files, we can decrypt a few non-critical files at no cost.
If we reach an agreement, we will keep all discussions private and delete the data we took.
