Let's explain the further steps in the situation:

    You can seek help from authorities - unfortunately, this path will not lead to a constructive resolution of the situation. 
        They will not assist you with decryption, seize your servers for OPsec, and your company's operations will be halted.
        Subsequently, the date will be disclosed, leading to fines, legal actions, and reputational damage.
    OR
    You initiate negotiations with us, and we reach a mutually beneficial and constructive solution for both parties.
        You pay a specified amount and receive the full decryption, support throughout the decryption process, 
        proofs that all information on our servers has been deleted, and a guarantee that it will never resurface, 
        ensuring no one learns about this incident.
