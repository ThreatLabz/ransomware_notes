<!> Warnings:

  - Do not go to recovery companies. 
    They secretly negotiate with us to decrypt a test file and use it to gain your trust
	and after you pay, they take the money and scam you.
	You can open chat links and see them chatting with us by yourself.
	
  - Do not use third-party tools.
    They might damage your files and cause permanent data loss.
