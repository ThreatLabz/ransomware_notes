  Cannot you find the files you need?
  Is the content of the files that you looked for not readable?
  
  It is normal because the files' names, as well as the data in your files
  have been encrypted.
  
  Great!!!
  You have turned to be a part of a big community #CerberRansomware.

  !!!  "Cerber Ransomware" has been removed from your computer.

  What is encryption?
  -------------------
  
  Encryption is a reversible modification of information for security
  reasons but providing full access to it for authorized users.
  
  To become an authorized user and keep the modification absolutely
  reversible (in other words to have a possibility to decrypt your files)
  you should have an individual private key.
  
  But not only it.
  
  It is required also to have the special decryption software
  (in your case "Cerber Decryptor" software) for safe and complete
  decryption of all your files and data.
  
  
  #########################################################################
  
  
  Everything is clear for me but what should I do?
  ------------------------------------------------
  
  The first step is reading these instructions to the end.
  
  Your files have been encrypted with the "Cerber Ransomware" software; the
  instructions ("# DECRYPT MY FILES #.html" and "# DECRYPT MY FILES #.txt")
  in the folders with your encrypted files are not viruses, they will
  help you.
  
  After reading this text the most part of people start searching in the
  Internet the words the "Cerber Ransomware" where they find a lot of
  ideas, recommendations and instructions.
  
  It is necessary to realize that we are the ones who closed the lock on
  your files and we are the only ones who have this secret key to
  open them.
  
  !!!  Any attempts to get back your files with the third-party tools can
  !!!  be fatal for your encrypted files.
  
  The most part of the third-party software change data within the
  encrypted file to restore it but this causes damage to the files.
  
  Finally it will be impossible to decrypt your files.
  
  When you make a puzzle but some items are lost, broken or not put in its
  place - the puzzle items will never match, the same way the third-party
  software will ruin your files completely and irreversibly.
  
  You should realize that any intervention of the third-party software to
  restore files encrypted with the "Cerber Ransomware" software may be
  fatal for your files.
  
  
  #########################################################################
  
  
  !!!  There are several plain steps to restore your files but if you do
  !!!  not follow them we will not be able to help you, and we will not try
  !!!  since you have read this warning already.
