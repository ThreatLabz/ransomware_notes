Your system has been secured with advanced encryption technology. All your files including personal data, financial reports, and important documents have been protected using military-grade encryption.

To restore access to your files and continue your business operations, you will need to obtain the decryption key. This is a standard security measure to ensure data integrity and prevent unauthorized access.

We strongly advise against attempting to use third-party decryption tools, as this may result in permanent data loss. Our encryption system is designed to be secure and cannot be bypassed by external tools.
