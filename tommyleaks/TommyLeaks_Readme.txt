Hi dears! This is TommyLeaks team and it is pleasure for us to inform you that your company network has been breached. We have stolen your files and documents and exfiltrated only the most sensitive and useful information from that.

First of all, remain calm and do not undertake any hasty actions at that moment if you want to save your reputation and avoid any bad scenarios:
- do not go to the authorities. They will perhaps confiscate your PCs and other IT equipment and will not prevent the process of your data leaking (hundred percent);
- do not contact any recovery agencies. They will just make money from your incident and of course try to cheat you. You will not save money at this case. It is better and cheaper for you to communicate with us on your own.

We're here not to rob you and won't be trying to intimidate you, we're just interested in helping you to rebuild your security infrastructure and be safe further. But of course our services cost money. How much? Will be known once we check your finance. We aren't going to ask for too much, so please do not try to bargain with us with no worthy arguments. Remember that all your files are in front of us.

As for the guarantees, we are committed to provide you with deletion log, breach report and other necessary materials once we receive the payment. We work for reputation and do not want some victim to spread any bad gossips about us or something, so be sure that the deal will be clean and honest. We guarantee that we will not attack your network again after payment but we will return in case deal falling through.

Once you are ready to move to the payment stage, there are some recommendations on how to do this securely:
- if you go to the bank to take a loan or just withdraw your funds, tell the bank that you need this money for the investment purposes only;
- if you have some troubles gaining bitcoins, just go to any exchange platform (coinbase.com, for instance) or a local broker to buy BTC from them for cash. That way no authorities or researchers do not trace your bank transfers. You may also go to the third party person who may make a transfer instead of you. 

So, that's it. And finally to contact us use this link - https://xir242nunyist4d7ksfnfmhnjx4gvqbuzo7eax4o3abqjesbxjshh4qd.onion/
You have to open the link only in TOR Browser (download it here: https://www.torproject.org). Then insert your password - [snip] - inside the field on the page and we will be able to communicate securely.

Please do not waste time because now it plays againts you.
