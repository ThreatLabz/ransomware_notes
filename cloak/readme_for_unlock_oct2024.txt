Urgent! Your files have been encrypted - act now to recover them!

Greetings,
We are a Ransomware Group, and we have successfully infiltrated your system and encrypted your valuable files.
We have the only working decryptor, which is the one way to restore your data.

Do not attempt to recover the files yourself or involve any third-party organizations, such as law enforcement or cybersecurity firms.
Any attempts to do so will result in the permanent deletion of your files without any chance of recovery.

To regain access to your files, you must follow these steps:
   Download & Install TOR browser: https://www.torproject.org/download/
   For contact us via LIVE CHAT open our

   If Tor is restricted in your area, use VPN.   We offer a free trial decryption of two insignificant files (<5 MB) to demonstrate our capabilities and build trust.
   We will provide you with further instructions and the exact amount of ransom required to decrypt your files.
   Make the payment in Bitcoin to the provided wallet address.
   Once the payment is confirmed, we will send you the decryptor.

Please note that you have a limited time to act before the deadline expires.
After that, the decryptor will be destroyed, and your files will remain encrypted forever.
Do not ignore this message or attempt to deceive us.
We have already infiltrated your system, and we can easily detect any attempts to bypass our ransom demands.

Take this situation seriously and act quickly to recover your files.
Write to us in the chat to begin the process.

Sincerely, Ransomware Group
