1. WHAT HAPPENED? <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Your company's network has been compromised by the HUNTERS INTERNATIONAL group.
All files are encrypted using a military-grade AES encryption algorithm.
A large amount of sensitive data was exfiltrated.

We usually download:

- Employees personal data: CVs, DL, SSN, PII, NDA contracts, etc.
- Financial information: documents, payrolls, bank statements, bills, transfers,
  budgets, annual reports, etc.
- Customer data: contracts, PII, contacts, purchase agreements, etc.
- Confidential: source code, trade secrets, technology, blueprints, documents, 
  etc.
- Work files, databases, legal documents, corporate correspondence.
- Accounting data.
- Audit reports.

4. KEEP IN MIND <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

- Do not try to decrypt using third-party software. You will damage the files.
- Do not report to the Police, FBI, etc. They don't care about your business.
  They simply won't allow you to pay. As a result, you will lose everything.
- Do not hire a recovery company. They can't decrypt without the key.
  They also don't care about your business. They believe that they are
  good negotiators, but it is not. They usually fail. So speak for yourself.
- Do not reject to pay. Exfiltrated files will be disclosed right away.
